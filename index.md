# Moin,

I am a PostDoc with [Vitalii Konarovskyi](https://konarovskyi.de) at University of Hamburg currently working on numerical approximations of stochastic (partial) differential equations of McKean--Vlasov type with common noise. 

My favourite pet project is the efficient simulation of iterated stochastic integrals (see [here](/software#levy_area_simulation)).
I am a supporter of open source software and an avid [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) user.
In my free time I enjoy juggling and bouldering.
