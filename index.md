# Moin,

I am a PhD student at the Institute of Mathematics at the [Universität zu Lübeck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de) currently working on numerical approximations of stochastic (partial) differential equations.

My favourite pet project is the efficient simulation of iterated stochastic integrals (see [here](/software#levy_area_simulation)).
I am a supporter of open source software and an avid [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) user.
In my free time I enjoy juggling and bouldering.
